== How to use DocWordCount ==

Build DocWordCount.java using the following command:
    javac -cp /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop/*:/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/* DocWordCount.java -d build -Xlint

Create the jar using the following command:
    jar -cvf docwordcount.jar -C build/ .

Run the program using the following command, substititing <INPUT> and <OUTPUT> for the path to your input and output directories on your hadoop cluster
    hadoop jar docwordcount.jar org.myorg.DocWordCount <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

DocWordCount will create a handful of files in your output directory, listing a count of words appearing per file. To view this output in your terminal use the following command
    hadoop fs -cat <OUTPUT>/*

Exact commands I used:
hadoop jar docwordcount.jar org.myorg.DocWordCount /user/jwoodli2/input /user/jwoodli2/output
hadoop fs -cat /user/jwoodli2/output/*
